You need to set the custom working directory in xcode.
    
    1. Open the example in "example/yuusha/proj.mac" by XCode. 
    2. Goto Product->Scheme->Edit Scheme.
    3. Click the left 'Run' tab, and find 'options'.
    4. Select the 'Use custom working directory:', and select the example's root directory, should be
    $(WHERE_YOU_PUT_THIS_PROJECT)/seal2d/example/yuusha
    5. Hit cmd+R, or click run to run the project. :)
